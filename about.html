                    I am 15 years old. This website is my proof of love to software making. It is made for my future software making company. 
                    I like coding, learning things (especially in tech), listening music, watching video, making games, aeronautics and a lot more things.
                    I already have some skills in differents techs fields, including CSS, HTML, PHP, JAVASCRIPT, C#, C++, UNITY and .NET MAUI framework.
                    If you want my resume you can contact me.
